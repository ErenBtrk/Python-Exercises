'''
This exercise is Part 1 of 4 of the birthday data exercise series. 
The other exercises are: Part 2, Part 3, and Part 4.

For this exercise, we will keep track of when our friendâ€™s birthdays are,
and be able to find that information based on their name. 
Create a dictionary (in your file) of names and birthdays.
When you run your program it should ask the user to enter a name,
and return the birthday of that person back to them. 
The interaction should look something like this:

>>> Welcome to the birthday dictionary. We know the birthdays of:
Albert Einstein
Benjamin Franklin
Ada Lovelace
>>> Who's birthday do you want to look up?
Benjamin Franklin
>>> Benjamin Franklin's birthday is 01/17/1706.
Happy coding!
